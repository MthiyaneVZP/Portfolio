    <a href="IMG_0361.PNG"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
    <p>I am a young Zulu girl who is passionate about pursuing a career in the technology industry. I grew up in a city called Pietermaritzburg in the South African province of Kwa-Zulu Natal. My whole life I have lived with my two older siblings - my older brother and my older sister. I adopted a loving for technology when my older sister was in high school and she did IT as one of her subjects, what inspired or motivated me the most was seeing her develop her ability to type on any keyboard blind, I was 6 afterall and thought it was the coolest thing in the world.</p>

    <h2>Educational History</h2>
    <p>My schooling history is as follows:</p>

    <p>Zenzeleni Creche</p>
    <p>This is where I began my school, it was a township creche that my mom took me to when she and my father were at work during the day, I was collected everyday by my older sister when she came back from school. I barely have any recollection of attending this creche because I was simply too young, from the information my mother gave me, I attended here everyday until I was around the age of 3 years old.</p>

    <P>Loluvuyo creche</P>
    <p>Once my older brother began primary school, my mother was forced to change my schools. Loluvuyo was also a township creche that I attended along side my cousins. It was strategically selected by my mother, because it was across the road from my granmother's home. i have fond memories in this creche because I like to think that this is where my immune system and character was developed. The teachers there aare forever engraved in my memory. I attended Loluvuyo until i was ready to be taken to pre-primary school.</p>

    <p>Little Souls Pre-Primary school</p>
    <p>I left Loluvuyo to begin my foundation phase learning. Little souls used to be the sister pre-primary school to longmarket primary school. Up until my pre-primary school years, i only knew one language - isiZulu. At Little souls, i was pushed out of my comfort zone by the environment and the challenges of learning a new language. I struggled quite a bit the first year of attending a =n English medium school, thankfully, the lord blessed me with the ability to learn reletively quickly so i was not strugglng for too long before i could construct a proper English sentence. My best memory at little souls was dress up time where i got to cosplay the fairy godmother from Cinderella. I attended little souls until i was the age of 6 when i began grade 1.</p>
    
    <p>Longmarket primary school</p>
    <p>I started primary school at the age of 6. After years of struggling with English, i finally had a vocabulary good enough to be communicate. I was excited for grade one and still remeber my teacher until this very day. She had blond hair and blue eyes, with the sweetest personality ever. I thank her everyday because she improved my English fluency. I went to Longmarket until i was around the age of 9. In my grade 4 year, my father uprooted ,y whole family to the Eastern Cape because he found a new job in Port Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>Harvest Christan School</p>
    <p>Even though i had a short 3 month stay at Harvest, that school had a great impact on me because it grew my christian faith while simultaneously allowing me to experience another province. I can truly say i thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Harvest, the teachers were kind and the bond that i grew with my brother and my father is unmatched.</p>

    <p>Northtern Park Primary School</p>
    <p>This primary school was the pinnacle of my lived experiences. It shaped who i am as a person today. I attended Northern Park from grade 4 up until grade 7. a majority of my major milestones were experienced on the premises of this school. To this day i often go back to see my former teachers who had a major impact on me and taught me valuable life lessons.</p>

    <p>Carter High School</p>
    <p>Where i met the people i want to call best friends for life. Despite having a majorly horrible experience in high school because of bullying and bad friendships, i thank High school because it built my confidence and made me realise that its just another passing experience and nothing that you should dwell on and let if=t affect your functoning as a person.</p>

    <p>The University of the Free State</p>
    <p>I have to say that this has been the best 3 years of my life. Where i have developed my employment skills and learnt to juggle having a personal life and still succeeding academically. I cant wait to what is next in store for myself.</p>
